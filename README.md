# Chrome extension used to accelerate whatsapp web audios

This is the first Google Chrome Extension I made, and its purpose is to accelerate audios from Whatsapp Web.

This is a beta version and it was made just for fun. But, if you want to use it, here are the instructions of how to do that: 

1. Download or clone that project.
2. Type this on Chrome search bar: chrome://extensions.
3. Activate the developer mode on upper right.
5. Make sure the project folder is named "whatsapp-audio-accelerate".
4. Drag and drop the project's folder on extensions screen you just opened.

That's it. Now, if you open the Whatsapp Web page, you will notice a new button "2x" on upper left... just click on it and the audios will accelerate twice.
